        I've been meaning to make some sort of emulator for a while, and a Gameboy emulator is just enough
        of a challenge. I'm writing it in C because I'm familiar with it, but I also need to practice it, as
        I am constantly being reminded that I will need to be well-versed in C/C++. In the future, I intend to 
        rewrite this project in Rust for practice, and make an Atari 2600 emulator.
